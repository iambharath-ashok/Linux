#	Windows Vs. Linux File System
	
##	Linux vs Windows: What's the Difference?

-	In Microsoft Windows, files are stored in folders on different data drives like C: D: E:
-	But, in Linux, files are ordered in a tree structure starting with the root directory.
-	This root directory can be considered as the start of the file system, and it further branches out various other subdirectories
-	The root is denoted with a forward slash '/'


##	Types of Files

-	General Files
	
	-	General Files also called as Ordinary files.
	-	They can contain image, video, program or simply text.
	-	They can be in ASCII or a Binary format. 
	-	These are the most commonly used files by Linux Users.
	
-	Directory Files

	-	These files are a warehouse for other file types. 
	-	You can have a directory file within a directory (sub-directory).
	
-	Device Files:
	
	-	In MS Windows, devices like Printers, CD-ROM, and hard drives are represented as drive letters like G: H:. 
	-	In Linux, there are represented as files.
	-	For example, if the first SATA hard drive had three primary partitions, they would be named and numbered as /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3.
	-	All device files reside in the directory /dev/
	
-	All the above file types (including devices) have permissions, which allow a user to read, edit or execute (run) them
-	This is a powerful Linux/Unix feature.
-	Access restrictions can be applied for different kinds of users, by changing permissions


##	Windows Vs. Linux: Users

-	There are 3 types of users in Linux.

	-	Regular
	-	Administrative(root)
	-	Service
	
	-	Regular User
	
		-	A regular user account is created for you when you install Ubuntu on your system
		-	All your files and folders are stored in /home/ which is your home directory. 
		-	As a regular user, you do not have access to directories of other users.
		
	-	Root User

		-	Other than your regular account another user account called root is created at the time of installation. 
		-	The root account is a superuser who can access restricted files, install software and has administrative privileges. 
		-	Whenever you want to install software, make changes to system files or perform any administrative task on Linux; 
		-	you need to log in as a root user. Otherwise, for general tasks like playing music and browsing the internet, you can use your regular account.



	-	Service user
		
		-	Linux is widely used as a Server Operating System. 
		-	Services such as Apache, Squid, email, etc. have their own individual service accounts.  
		-	Having service accounts increases the security of your computer. 
		-	Linux can allow or deny access to various resources depending on the service.
		
		

-	In Windows, there are 4 types of user account types

	-	Administrator
	-	Standard
	-	Child
	-	Guest

##	Windows Vs. Linux: Other Directories
	
-	In Windows, System and Program files are usually saved in C: drive. 
-	But, in Linux, you would find the system and program files in different directories.
-	For example, the boot files are stored in the /boot directory, and program and software files can be found under /bin device files in /dev.
-	Below are important Linux Directories and a short description of what they contain
