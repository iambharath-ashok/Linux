# Copying files commands


##	cp (copy)


-	cp file1 file2 is the command which makes a copy of file1 in the current working directory and calls it file2

	cp /vol/ee/ee-info/Teaching/Unix/science.txt .
	
-	Note: Don't forget the dot . at the end. Remember, in UNIX, the dot means the current directory.


##	Moving files


-	mv (move)

-	mv file1 file2 moves (or renames) file1 to file2
-	To move a file from one place to another, use the mv command. This has the effect of moving rather than copying the file, so you end up with only one file rather than two.
-	It can also be used to rename a file, by moving the file to the same directory, but giving it a different name.


##	Removing files and directories

-	rm (remove), rmdir (remove directory)

##	Displaying the contents of a file on the screen

-	clear (clear screen)
-	cat (concatenate)

	-	The command cat can be used to display the contents of a file on the screen. Type:

			% cat science.txt

	-	As you can see, the file is longer than than the size of the window, so it scrolls past making it unreadable.
	
	
##	less

-	The command less writes the contents of a file onto the screen a page at a time. Type

##	head

-	The head command writes the first ten lines of a file to the screen.


		% head science.txt

		Then type

		% head -5 science.txt

-	What difference did the -5 do to the head command?	

##	tail

-	writes last 10 lines to screen


##	wc (word count)

-	A handy little utility is the wc command, short for word count. 
-	To do a word count on science.txt, type

		wc -w science.txt
		
-	To find out how many lines the file has, type
	
		wc -l science.txt
