#	File Permissions in Linux/Unix with Example

-	multi-user operating system which can be accessed by many users simultaneously
-	Linux can also be used in mainframes and servers without any modifications
-	But this raises security concerns as an unsolicited or malign user can corrupt, change or remove crucial data
-	For effective security, Linux divides authorization into 2 levels.

	-	Ownership
	-	Permission
	

##	Ownership of Linux files


-	Every file and directory on your Unix/Linux system is assigned 3 types of owner, given below.

	-	User
		-	A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner.
		-	Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner.


	-	Group
		-	A user- group can contain multiple users. 
		-	All users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file. 
		-	Suppose you have a project where a number of people require access to a file. 
		-	Instead of manually assigning permissions to each user, 
			-	you could add all users to a group, and assign group permission to file 
			-	such that only this group members and no one else can read or modify the files.


	-	Other
		-	Any other user who has access to a file
		-	This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could own the file
		-	Practically, it means everybody else. 
		-	Hence, when you set the permission for others, it is also referred as set permissions for the world
		-	how does Linux distinguish between these three user types 
			-	so that a user 'A' cannot affect a file which contains some other user 'B's' vital information/data	
		-	It is like you do not want your colleague, who works on your Linux computer, to view your images. 
		-	This is where Permissions set in, and they define user behavior	
		

##	Permissions
	
	-	Every file and directory in your UNIX/Linux system has following 3 permissions defined for all the 3 owners discussed above.
	
	-	Read: 
		-	This permission give you the authority to open and read a file
		-	Read permission on a directory gives you the ability to lists its content
		
	-	Write: 
		-	open -> read -> write(modify)
		-	The write permission gives you the authority to modify the contents of a file. 
		-	The write permission on a directory gives you the authority to add, remove and rename files stored in the directory
		-	Consider a scenario where you have to write permission on file but do not have write permission on the directory where the file is stored
		-	You will be able to modify the file contents.
		-	But you will not be able to rename, move or remove the file from the directory.
	
	-	Execute: 
		-	In Windows, an executable program usually has an extension ".exe" and which you can easily run. 
		-	In Unix/Linux, you cannot run a program unless the execute permission is set. 
		-	If the execute permission is not set, you might still be able to see/modify the program code
			-	(provided read & write permissions are set), but not run it.
			

			
##	Changing file/directory permissions with 'chmod' command

-	chmod permissions filename
-	There are 2 ways to use the command -

	-	Absolute mode
	-	Symbolic mode
	
-	Absolute(Numeric) Mode

	-	In this mode, file permissions are not represented as characters but a three-digit octal number.
		
	The table below gives numbers for all for permissions types.
	

Number	| Permission Type	| Symbol
------- | ----------------- | --------
0 |	No Permission |	---
1 |	Execute	|--x
2 |	Write	|-w-
3 |	Execute + Write	|-wx
4 |	Read	|r--
5 |	Read + Execute	|r-x
6 |	Read +Write	|rw-
7 |	Read + Write +Execute	|rwx	

			
			
-	chmod 745 a.txt b.txt



##	Symbolic Mode


-	In the Absolute mode, you change permissions for all 3 owners. 
-	In the symbolic mode, you can modify permissions of a specific owner. 
-	It makes use of mathematical symbols to modify the file permissions.

Operator|	Description
--------|------------------
+	|Adds a permission to a file or directory
-	|Removes the permission
=	|Sets the permission and overrides the permissions set earlier.
	


-	The various owners are represented as -

User |Denotations
-----|----------
u |	user/owner
g |	group
o |	other
a |	all


##	Changing Ownership and Group
	
	
-	For changing the ownership of a file/directory, you can use the following command:
	-	chown user
		chown sample.txt
		
-	In case you want to change the user as well as group for a file or directory use the command

	-	chown user:group filename
		chown bharath:bharath sample.txt
	
-	In case you want to change group-owner only, use the command

	-	chgrp group_name filename
		chgrp guru sample.txt
		


##	Group Details

	-	The file /etc/group contains all the groups defined in the system
	-	You can use the command "groups" to find all the groups you are a member of
	-	You can use the command newgrp to work as a member a group other than your default group
	-	You cannot have 2 groups owning the same file.
	-	You do not have nested groups in Linux. One group cannot be sub-group of other
	-	x- eXecuting a directory means Being allowed to "enter" a dir and gain possible access to sub-dirs
