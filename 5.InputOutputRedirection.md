#	Input Output Redirection in Linux/Unix Examples


##	What is Redirection?

-	Redirection is a feature in Linux such that when executing a command, you can change the standard input/output devices
-	The basic workflow of any Linux command is that it takes an input and give an output

	-	The standard input (stdin) device is the keyboard
	-	The standard output (stdout) device is the screen
	
-	With redirection, the above standard input/output can be changed.

##	Output Redirection

-	The '>' symbol is used for output (STDOUT) redirection.
-	ls -al > listings
-	Use the correct file name while redirecting command output to a file. 
-	If there is an existing file with the same name, the redirected command will delete the contents of that file and then it may be overwritten."	
-	If you do not want a file to be overwritten but want to add more content to an existing file, then you should use '>>' operator.
-	You can redirect standard output, to not just files, but also devices!
	
		$ cat music.mp3 > /dev/audio

-	The cat command reads the file music.mp3 and sends the output to /dev/audio which is the audio device. 
-	If the sound configurations in your PC are correct, this command will play the file music.mp3


##	Input redirection

-	The '<' symbol is used for input(STDIN) redirection
	
		mail -s "Mail From Linux Comamnd" me@imbh.com < mailbody.txt
	
	-	This would attach the file with the email, and it would be sent to the recipient.

	
##	File Descriptors (FD)

-	In Linux/Unix, everything is a file. 
-	Regular file, Directories, and even Devices are files. 
-	Every File has an associated number called File Descriptor (FD).

	
	-	Screen also has a File Descriptor. 
	-	When a program is executed the output is sent to File Descriptor of the screen,
	-	And we will see program output on your monitor. 
	-	If the output is sent to File Descriptor of the printer, the program output would have been printed
	
##	Error Redirection

-	Whenever you execute a program/command at the terminal, 3 files are always open, viz., standard input, standard output, standard error
-	These files are always present whenever a program is run
-	File descriptor, is associated with each of these files


File|	File Descriptor
----|-----------------
Standard Input STDIN |	0
Standard Output STDOUT |	1
Standard Error STDERR |	2


##	Why Error Redirection?

-	Error re-direction is one of the very popular features of Unix/Linux.
-	Frequent UNIX users will reckon that many commands give you massive amounts of errors.

	-	For instance, while searching for files, one typically gets permission denied errors. 
		-	These errors usually do not help the person searching for a particular file.
	-	While executing shell scripts, you often do NOT want error messages cluttering up the normal program output.
	
-	The solution is to re-direct the error messages to a file.
	
-	Example 1

		$ myprogram 2>errorsfile

	-	The file descriptor for standard error is 2.
	-	Using "2>" we re-direct the error output to a file named "errorfile"

-	Example 2

		find . -name 'my*' 2>error.log
	
	-	Using the "find" command, we are searching the "." current directory for a file with "name" starting with "my"

-	Example 3 Let's see a more complex example,

		ls Documents ABC> dirlist 2>&1
	
		-	which writes the output from one file to the input of another file
		-	2>&1 means that STDERR redirects to the target of STDOUT (which is the file dirlist)
		-	We are redirecting error output to standard output which in turn is being re-directed to file dirlist
		-	Hence, both the output is written to file dirlist
		
##	Summary

-	Each file in Linux has a corresponding File Descriptor associated with it
-	The keyboard is the standard input device while your screen is the standard output device
-	">" is the output redirection operator. ">>" appends output to an existing file
-	"<" is the input redirection operator
-	">&"re-directs output of one file to another.
-	You can re-direct error using its corresponding File Descriptor 2.
