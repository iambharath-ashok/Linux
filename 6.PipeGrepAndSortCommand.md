#	Pipe, Grep and Sort Command in Linux/Unix with Examples


##	What is a Pipe in Linux?

-	The Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use two or more commands such that output of one command serves as input to the next
-	In short, the output of each process directly as input to the next one like a pipeline
-	The symbol '|' denotes a pipe

-	Pipes help you mash-up two or more commands at the same time and run them consecutively.
- 	You can use powerful commands which can perform complex tasks in a jiffy.

-	When you use 'cat' command to view a file which spans multiple pages, the prompt quickly jumps to the last page of the file, and you do not see the content in the middle.

	cat numbers | less
	

##	'pg' and 'more' commands


-	Instead of 'less', you can also use.

		cat Filename | pg  or cat Filename | more

-	And, you can view the file in digestible bits and scroll down by simply hitting the enter key.


##	The 'grep' command

-	Suppose you want to search a particular information the postal code from a text file.
-	A better option is to use the grep command. 
-	It will scan the document for the desired information and present the result in a format you want.

		grep search_string
		
		cat sample | grep eat
		
	-	Here, grep command has searched the file 'sample', for the string 'Apple' and 'Eat'.

	
Option	| Function
--------|-----------
-v	| Shows all the lines that do not match the searched string
-c	| Displays only the count of matching lines
-n	| Shows the matching line and its number
-i	| Match both (upper and lower) case
-l	| Shows just the name of the file with the string

	
-	Examples:

		cat numbers | grep  23 -v
		cat numbers | grep 23 -c
		cat numbers | grep 90 -n
	cat fruits | grep mongo -i
	grep bharath -l

	
##	The 'sort' command
	
	
-	This command helps in sorting out the contents of a file alphabetically.
-	syntax:
		
		sort Filename

Option | Function
---|-------------
-r |Reverses  sorting
-n |Sorts numerically
-f |Case insensitive sorting 

-	sort numbers -n 
-	sort numbers -r
-	sort numbers -f 
-	sort numbers


##	What is a Filter?

-	Linux has a lot of filter commands like awk, grep, sed, spell, and wc.
-	A filter takes input from one command, does some processing, and gives output.
-	When you pipe two commands, the "filtered " output of the first command is given to the next.


-	We want to highlight only the lines that do not contain the character 'a', but the result should be in reverse order.

		
		cat fruits | grep -v a | sort -r
