#	List of Environment Variables in Linux/Unix

##	What is a Computing Environment?

-	The Computing environment is the Platform(Platform = Operating System+ Processor) where a user can run programs.

##	What is a Variable?

-	variable is a location for storing a value which can be a filename, text, number or any other data
-	It is usually referred to with its Symbolic name which is given to it while creation
-	The value thus stored can be displayed, deleted, edited and re-saved
-	Variables play an important role in computer programming because they enable programmers to write flexible programs.
- 	As they are related to the Operating system that we work on, it is important to know some of them and how we can influence them.


##	What are Environment variables?

-	Environment variables are dynamic values which affect the processes or programs on a computer.
- 	They exist in every operating system, but types may vary.
-	Environment variables can be created, edited, saved, and deleted and give information about the system behavior.
-	Environment variables can change the way a software/programs behave.

	-	E.g. $LANG environment variable stores the value of the language that the user understands. 

-	Environment variables govern the behavior of programs in your Operating System.


Variable | Description
---------|--------------
PATH	|This variable contains a colon (:)-separated list of directories in which your system looks for executable files.When you enter a command on terminal, the shell looks for the command in different directories mentioned in the $PATH variable. If the command is found, it executes. Otherwise, it returns with an error 'command not found'.
USER	| The username
HOME	| Default path to the user's home directory
EDITOR	| Path to the program which edits the content of files
UID	 | User's unique ID
TERM	|Default terminal emulator
SHELL	| Shell being used by the user	
	
	
	
##	Accessing Variable values

-	In order to determine value of a variable, use the command
	-	echo $VARIABLE
-	'$'	sign is mandatory
- 	env and printenv command displays all the env variables and its values


##	Set New Environment Variables

-	VARIABLE_NAME= variable_value
-	variables are case-sensitive and usually they are created in upper case


##	Deleting Variables

-	unset variablename
-	This would remove the Variable and its value permanently.
-	Examples:

		>$ VARIABLE1= 1234
		>$ echo $VARIABLE1
		>$	unset VARIABLE1
		>$ echo VARIABLE1
		

Command	|Description
--------|------------
echo $VARIABLE	|To display value of a variable
env	| Displays all environment variables
VARIABLE_NAME= variable_value  |	Create a new variable
unset  | 	Remove a variable
export Variable=value |	To set value of an environment variable
