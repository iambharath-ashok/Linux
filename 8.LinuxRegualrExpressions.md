#	Linux Regular Expression Tutorial: Grep Regex Example

##	What are Regular Expressions?

-	Regular expressions are special characters which help search data, matching complex patterns.
-	Regular expressions are shortened as 'regexp' or 'regex'.


##	Types of Regular expressions

-	Basic Regular expressions
-	Some of the commonly used commands with Regular expressions are tr, sed, vi and grep.

Symbol	| Descriptions
-------- | -----------------
.	| replaces any character
^	| matches start of string
$	| matches end of string
*	| matches up zero or more times the preceding character
\	| Represent special characters
()	| Groups regular expressions
?	| Matches up exactly zero or one character



-	Examples :
	
		cat sample
		cat sample | grep a
		cat sample | grep ^a
		cat sample | grep a$
		cat sample | grep t
		cat sample | grep t$

##	Interval Regular expressions

-	These expressions tell us about the number of occurrences of a character in a string. They are

Expression | Description
---------- | --------------
{n}  | Matches the preceding character appearing 'n' times exactly
{n,m}	| Matches the preceding character appearing 'n' times but not more than m
{n, }	| Matches the preceding character only when it appears 'n' times or more


- Examples:

	grep -E p\{2}
	
-	You need to add -E with these regular expressions.

	

##	Extended regular expressions
	
Expression	| Description
---------- | ------------
\+ | Matches one or more occurrence of the previous character
\? | Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character	


-	Examples:

		cat sample | grep "a\+t"


##	Brace expansion


-	The syntax for brace expansion is either a sequence or a comma separated list of items inside curly braces "{}".
- 	The starting and ending items in a sequence are separated by two periods "..".

-	Examples:

		echo a{1..5}b
		echo proc{1..9}.java
		echo {aa,bb,cc,dd}
