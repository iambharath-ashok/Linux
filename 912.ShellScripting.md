#	Shell Scripting Tutorial for Linux/Unix Beginners

##	What is a Shell?

-	An Operating is made of many components, but its two prime components are -

	- 	Kernel 
	-	Shell
	
		
		
	-	Hardware -> OS(Shell and Kernel) -> Terminal -> User
	

## 	Kernel

-	A Kernel is at the nucleus of a computer
-	It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible
-	While the Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost one


## Shell

-	A shell in a Linux operating system takes input from you in the form of commands, processes it, and then gives an output
-	It is the interface through which a user works on the programs, commands, and scripts
-	A shell is accessed by a terminal which runs it
-	When you run the terminal, the Shell issues a command prompt (usually $)
	-	where you can type your input, which is then executed when you hit the Enter key

- 	The output or the result is thereafter displayed on the terminal
-	The Shell wraps around the delicate interior of an Operating system protecting it from accidental damage. 
-	Hence the name Shell.


##	Types of Shell
	
-	There are two main shells in Linux:

	1. The Bourne Shell
	2. The C shell
	
	
-	1. The Bourne Shell: The prompt for this shell is $ and its derivatives are listed below:

		-	POSIX shell also is known as sh
		-	Korn Shell also knew as sh
		-	Bourne Again SHell also knew as bash (most popular)	
	
-	2. The C shell: The prompt for this shell is %, and its subcategories are:

		-	C shell also is known as csh
		-	Tops C shell also is known as tcsh	


##	What is Shell Scripting?

-	Shell scripting is writing a series of command for the shell to execute
-	It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script
	-	which can be stored and executed anytime
-	This reduces the effort required by the end user
	
	-	Create a file using a vi editor(or any other editor).  Name  script file with extension .sh
	-	Start the script with #! /bin/sh
	-	Write some code.
	-	For executing the script type bash filename.sh
	-	Save the script file as filename.sh


-	"#!" is an operator called shebang which directs the script to the interpreter location. 
-	So, if we use"#! /bin/sh" the script gets directed to the bourne-shell.

	vi listingfiles.sh
	
	#! /bin/sh

	ls -al
	
	bash listingfiles.sh
	
	


##	What are Shell Variables?

-	Variables store data in the form of characters and numbers
-	Similarly, Shell variables are used to store information and they can by the shell only


-	For example, the following creates a shell variable and then prints it:

		variable ="Hello"
		echo $variable


-	Below is a small script which will use a variable:

		#!/bin/sh
		echo "what is your name?"
		read name
		echo "How do you do, $name?"
		read remark
		echo "I am $remark too!"



##	Summary:

-	Kernel is the nucleus of the operating systems, and it communicates between hardware and software
-	Shell is a program which interprets user commands through CLI like Terminal
-	The Bourne shell and the C shell are the most used shells in Linux
-	Shell scripting is writing a series of command for the shell to execute
-	Shell variables store the value of a string or a number for the shell to read
-	Shell scripting can help you create complex programs containing conditional statements, loops, and functions
