#	Linux/Unix User Administration Tutorial: adduser, usermod, userdel

-	As Linux is a multi-user operating system, 
-	there is a high need of an administrator, who can manage user accounts, their rights, and the overall system security.

##	Creating a User

-	Step 1) Use command sudo adduser

		sudo adduser bharath
		
-	Step 2) Enter the new password for new account and confirm

-	Step 3) Enter the details of new user and Press Y

	
##	Deleting, disabling account

-	Terminal

	-	Disabling account:
	
		-	For disabling an account using Terminal, remove the password set on the account.
		
		
			sudo passwd -l bharath
			
		-	Enter the sudo password and user will be disabled

		
	-	Deleting account
		
		-	To delete an account use the command
		
			sudo userdel -r 'username'
			
			
			
			
##	Adding users to the usergroups

-	You can view the existing groups on your Linux operating system by entering the following command:

		groupmod "Press Tab key twice"
	
-	Now to add a user to a group, use the following syntax:

		sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME USERNAME
		
		sudo usermod  -a -G home bharath
	
-	The system would ask for authentication and then it would add the user to the group.
-	You can check whether the user is in a group by this command.

		cat /etc/group
			
-	It shows 
				home:x:1000:bharath
	
##	Removing users from group

-	Use the following syntax for removing a user.


		sudo deluser USER GROUPNAME
		
		sudo deleuser bharath home

			
##	Finger

-	This command is used to procure information of the users on a Linux machine.
-	You can use it on both local & remote machines 

	-	The syntax 'finger' gives data on all the logged users on the remote and local machine.
	-	The syntax 'finger username' specifies the information of the user.

		finger bharath
		
			-	Gives the details of the user and commands executing by the user
