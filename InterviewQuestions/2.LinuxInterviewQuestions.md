#	Top 60 Linux Interview Questions & Answers

##	1) What is Linux?

-	Linux is a multi-user and multi-tasking OS based on the Unix
-	There are wide varieties of flavors of distributions


##	2) What is the difference between UNIX and LINUX?

-	Unix originally began as a propriety operating system from Bell Laboratories, 
	-	which later on spawned into different commercial versions.
-	On the other hand, Linux is free, open source and intended as a non-propriety operating system for the masses.

##	3) What is BASH?

-	BASH is short for Bourne Again SHell. 
-	It was written by Steve Bourne as a replacement to the original Bourne Shell (represented by /bin/sh). 
-	It combines all the features from the original version of Bourne Shell
	-	plus additional functions to make it easier and more convenient to use
-	It has since been adapted as the default shell for most systems running Linux


##	4) What is Linux Kernel?

-	Kernel is nucleus or heart of the Linux
-	OS will have only kernel
-	Kernel main role is to manage hardware resorces for the users
-	It is also used to provide an interface for user-level interaction


##	5) What is LILO?

-	LILO is a boot loader
-	t is used mainly to load the Linux operating system into main memory so that it can begin its operations.


##	6) What is a swap space?

-	Swap space is a certain amount of space used by Linux 
-	To  hold some programs  temporarily that are running concurrently. 
-	This happens when RAM does not have enough memory to hold all programs that are executing

##	7) What is the advantage of open source?

-	Open source allows you to distribute your software, including source codes freely to anyone who is interested. 
-	People would then be able to add features and even debug and correct errors that are in the source code. 
-	They can even make it run better and then redistribute these enhanced source code freely again. 
-	This eventually benefits everyone in the community.

##	8 ) What are the basic components of Linux?

-	Linux has all of these components: kernel, shells and GUIs, system utilities, and an application program

##	9) Does it help for a Linux system to have multiple desktop environments installed?

-	In general, one desktop environment, like KDE or Gnome, is good enough to operate without issues 
-	It's all a matter of preference for the user, although the system allows switching from one environment to another
- 	Some programs will work in one environment and not work on the other, 
	-	so it could also be considered a factor in selecting which environment to use
	
	
##	10) What is the basic difference between BASH and DOS?


-	The key differences between the BASH and DOS console lie in 3 areas:
- 	BASH commands are case sensitive while DOS commands are not;
- 	Under BASH, / character is a directory separator and \ acts as an escape character. Under DOS, / serves as a command argument delimiter and \ is the directory separator
- 	DOS follows a convention in naming files, which is 8 character file name followed by a dot and 3 characters for the extension. BASH follows no such convention.	


##	11) What is the importance of the GNU project?

-	This so-called Free software movement allows several advantages
-	such as the freedom to run programs for any purpose and freedom to study and modify a program to your needs
-	It also allows you to redistribute copies of software to other people, 
	-	as well as the freedom to improve software and have it released for the public

##	12) Describe the root account.

-	The root account is like a systems administrator account and allows you full control of the system.
-	Here you can create and maintain user accounts, assigning different permissions for each account
-	It is the default account every time you install Linux.


##	13) What is CLI?

-	CLI is short for Command Line Interface.
-	This interface allows the user to type declarative commands to instruct the computer to perform operations
- 	CLI offers greater flexibility. 



##	15) How do you open a command prompt when issuing a command?

-	To open the default shell (which is where the command prompt can be found), press Ctrl-Alt-F1.
-	This will provide a command line interface (CLI) from which you can run commands as needed.

##	16) How can you find out how much memory Linux is using?

-	From a command shell, use the "concatenate" command: 
	
		cat /proc/meminfo for memory usage information
		
	-	This is the total memory Linux thinks it has available to use
	
-	You can also use commands

		free - m
		vmstat
		top
		htop	

##	17) What is a typical size for a swap partition under a Linux system?

-	The preferred size for a swap partition is twice the amount of physical memory available on the system. 
-	If this is not possible, then the minimum size should be the same as the amount of memory installed.


##	18) What are symbolic links?

-	Symbolic links act similarly to shortcuts in Windows.
- 	Such links point to programs, files or directories.
- 	It also allows you instant access to it without having to go directly to the entire pathname.


##	19) Does the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination work on Linux?

-	Yes, it does. Just like Windows, you can use this key combination to perform a system restart. One difference is that you won't be getting any confirmation message and therefore, a reboot is immediate.

##	20) How do you refer to the parallel port where devices such as printers are connected?

-	Under Windows parallel port are referred to as the LPT port, under Linux you refer to it as /dev/lp.
- 	LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 would therefore be referred to as /dev/lp0, /dev/lp1, or /dev/lp2 under Linux.

##	21) Are drives such as hard drive and floppy drives represented with drive letters?

-	No. In Linux, each drive and device have different designations.
- 	For example, floppy drives are referred to as /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1. 
-	IDE/EIDE hard drives are referred to as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, and so forth.

##	22) How do you change permissions under Linux?

-	symbolic manner
-	absolute manner

##	23) In Linux, what names are assigned to the different serial ports?

-	Serial ports are identified as /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyS7. 
-	These are the equivalent names of COM1 to COM8 in Windows.

##	25) What are hard links?

-	Hard links point directly to the physical file on disk, and not on the pathname.
- 	This means that if you rename or move the original file, the link will not break 
-	since the link is for the file itself, not the path where the file is located.


##	26) What is the maximum length for a filename under Linux?

-	Any filename can have a maximum of 255 characters. 
-	This limit does not include the path name, so therefore the entire pathname and filename could well exceed 255 characters.


##	27)What are filenames that are preceded by a dot?

-	In general, filenames that are preceded by a dot are hidden files.
- 	These files can be configuration files that hold important data or setup info.
- 	Setting these files as hidden makes it less likely to be accidentally deleted.


##	31) What is the pwd command?

-	shows present working directory

##	32) What are daemons?

- 	Its main task is to listen for service request and at the same time to act on these requests. 
-	Daemons are services that provide several functions that may not be available under the base operating system.
-	After the service is done, it is then disconnected and waits for further requests.


##	34) What are the kinds of permissions under Linux?

-	There are 3 kinds of permissions under Linux:
	-	Read: users may read the files or list the directory
	- 	Write: users may write to the file of new files to the directory
	-	Execute: users may run the file or lookup a specific file within a directory
	
##	35) How does case sensitivity affect the way you use commands?
	
-	commands are considered identical only if every character is encoded as is, including lowercase and uppercase letters
- 	This means that CD, cd, and Cd are three different commands. 
-	Entering a command using uppercase letters, where it should be in lowercase, will produce different outputs

##	36) What are environmental variables?

-	Another common term for environmental variables is global shell variables.
-	Environmental variables are global settings that control the shell's function as well as that of other Linux programs.

##	37) What are the different modes when using vi editor?

-	Command Mode 
-	Insert mode

##	39) What is redirection?

-	Redirection is the process of directing data from one output to another.
- 	It can also be used to direct an output as an input to another process.


##	40) What is grep command?

-	grep a search command that makes use of pattern-based searching.
- 	It makes use of options and parameters that are specified along with the command line 
-	applies this pattern in searching the required file output.

##	41) What could be the problem when a command that was issued gave a different result from the last time it was used?

-	One highly possible reason for getting different results from what seems to be the same command has something to do with case sensitivity issues


##	42) What are the contents of /usr/local?

-	It contains locally installed files. 
-	This directory matters in environments where files are stored on the network
-	locally-installed files go to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib
-	Another application of this directory is that it is used for software packages installed from source, or software not officially shipped with the distribution


##	43) How do you terminate an ongoing process?

-	Every process in the system is identified by a unique process id or pid. 
-	Use the kill command followed by the pid to terminate that process.
-	To terminate all process at once, use kill 0.


##	45) What is command grouping and how does it work?

-	You can use parentheses to group commands. 
-	For example, if you want to send the current date and time along with the contents of a file named OUTPUT 
	-	to a second file named MYDATES, you can apply command grouping as follows: 
	
			
			(date cat OUTPUT) > MYDATES
			
##	47) Write a command that will look for files with an extension "c", and has the occurrence of the string "apple" in it.

				
				
		find . -name "*.c" | xargs  grep  "apple" -i		
		
##	48) Write a command that will display all .txt files, including its individual permission.

		ls -al *.txt	
	

##	49) Write a command that will do the following:

-look for all files in the current and subsequent directories with an extension c,v
-strip the,v from the result (you can use sed command)
-use the result and use a grep command to search for all occurrences of the word ORANGE in the files.

		Find ./ -name "*.c,v" | sed 's/,v//g' | xargs grep "ORANGE"	


##	50) What, if anything, is wrong with each of the following commands?

-	a) ls -l-s
-	b) cat file1, file2
-	c) ls - s Factdir
	
	Answers:
	
	-	a) there should be space between the 2 options: ls -l -s
	-	b) do not use commas to separate arguments: cat file1 file2
	-	c) there should be no space between hyphen and option label: ls –s Factdir



##	51) What is the command to calculate the size of a folder?

		To calculate the size of a folder uses the command du –sh folder1


##	52) How can you find the status of a process?

		ps ux

##	53) How can you check the memory status?

-	You can use the command

		free -m to display output in MB
		
		free -g to display output in GB
	

##	55) How can you append one file to another in Linux?

-	To append one file to another in Linux you can use command cat file2 >> file 1. 
-	The operator >> appends the output of the named file or creates the file if it is not created. 
-	While another command cat file 1 file 2 > file 3 appends two or more files to one.



##	56) Explain how you can find a file using Terminal?

-	To find a file you have to use a command, 
		find . –name "process.txt" 
-	It will look for the current directory for a file called process.txt


##	58) Explain how you can view the text file using Terminal?

		less filename.txt
	
##	59) Explain how to enable curl on Ubuntu LAMP stack?

-	To enable curl on Ubuntu, first, install libcurl, once done use following command 
	sudo/etc/init .d /apache2 restart or sudo service apache2 restart
	

##	61) How can you run a Linux program in the background simultaneously when you start your Linux Server?

-	By using nohup. 
-	It will stop the process receiving the NOHUP signal and thus terminating it you log out of the program which was invoked with.
- 	& runs the process in the background.


##	62) Explain how to uninstall the libraries in Linux?

		
-	To uninstall the libraries in Linux, you can use command sudo apt-get remove library_name
